### 2. Macro Market Analysis
Understanding the broader cryptocurrency market dynamics and Solana-specific factors is critical to contextualizing this trade idea and assessing its viability.

#### 2.1 Cryptocurrency Market Overview
- **Market Sentiment**: As of the latest data, the cryptocurrency market exhibits cautious optimism. Bitcoin (BTC), the market bellwether, is consolidating near $60,000, a key psychological and technical resistance level. A breakout above this level could trigger a risk-on sentiment across altcoins, while a rejection may lead to heightened volatility.

Recent minutes from the Fed suggest a potential pause in rate hikes if inflation data softens, which could drive capital flows into speculative assets like cryptocurrencies. Conversely, persistent hawkish rhetoric or stronger-than-expected U.S. economic data (e.g., CPI or employment figures) could pressure risk assets in the short term.

Additionally, geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.-China relations or energy crises in Europe) could indirectly impact crypto markets through risk aversion in global equities.
- **Market Correlations**: SOL maintains a strong positive correlation with Ethereum (ETH) (30-day correlation coefficient: ~0.85) and other Layer-1 blockchain tokens like Avalanche (AVAX) and Cardano (ADA). A breakout in ETHâ€”potentially
